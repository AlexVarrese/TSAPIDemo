## TSAPIDemo

## About
TSAPIDemo is a demo application to develop a proper C# wrapper for Avaya's TSAPI library by testing all methods in a demo application.
At this moment, I am able to test Private Data versions up to 7 (AES 4.0). Everything above PDV 7 has to be tested by someone else.
You can look at project's wiki to see project progress so far

## Requirements
In order to work, TSAPIDemo requires the following:<br>
1)  AE Services server with enabled TSAPI service<br>
2)  Installed TSAPI client (specifically, csta32.dll, att32prv.dll, TSLIB.INI ).<br>
3)  .NET framework 3.5.<br>

## Configuring
You can configure the program by using Configuration tab or by editing TSAPIDemo.exe.config.
